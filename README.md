This project is a proof of concept for an idea I've had for a while. This could have easily been a code sandbox, but I wanted to try some things out with NextJS ðŸ˜….

The main idea is to have a website where each section is stacked on top of another section as you scroll through the page, on top of that, I wanted to try and add a parallax effect to each card.

I've used experimental NextJS for the initial setup, TailwindCSS for the styling, and react-spring for the animations.
